What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

In both Project One and Project Two, I worked on organizing and managing course data for a computer science program. The main goal was to figure out how to store, sort, and retrieve this data efficiently using different data structures. Project One focused more on comparing how well certain data structures perform, while Project Two involved actually building a working program that lets users view course info and prerequisites. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

To get started, I took time to understand exactly what the project was asking for. Then I decided which data structure made the most sense for each task. For example, a binary search tree worked well in Project Two because it keeps the course list sorted and makes it easy to search for a specific course. Understanding how each data structure works helped me figure out which one would give the best performance for what I needed to do. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

There were definitely some challenges along the way, especially when it came to reading data from the CSV file and getting the tree structure to work right. At first, I had trouble getting the formatting to load properly, and sometimes the course search didn’t return the expected results. I got through those issues by doing lots of testing, using the debugger in Visual Studio.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

Working on these projects taught me how important it is to think through the structure of your program before writing a single line of code. It’s not just about making it work. It’s about planning how to keep things organized and efficient. I also got better at thinking through how users will interact with the program and how data moves from one part to another. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

After doing these projects, I’ve started to focus more on writing code that’s clean and easy to understand. I now try to use meaningful variable names, break my code up into smaller functions, and include comments so it’s easier to follow. This helps me catch bugs quicker and makes it easier to go back and make changes later without getting lost in the code.
